# idx-omnibar
A WordPress Plugin creating an Omnibar Search Widget for use with IDX Broker.

DO NOT contact IDX Broker for support on this plugin as this is a third party plugin.

This is a WordPress plugin requiring the IDX Broker plugin to be installed.
From there, it pulls in Cities, Counties, and Zip Codes via the API allowing users to search by City, County, Zipcode, MLS#, and Address.

After downloading this file, unzip it, rename the folder as idx-omnibar and rezip it.
Make sure you have installed the IDX Broker plugin and entered your API key in the IDX Broker plugin settings, then install this plugin. Once installed, you will be able to add the IDX Omnibar widget to any widget area.

There are two widgets to choose from: the IDX Omnibar Classic version and the IDX Omnibar with Extra Fields (Max Price, Beds, and Baths).
