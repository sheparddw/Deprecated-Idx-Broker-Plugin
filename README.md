# Deprecated IDX Broker Plugin with Omnibar
This feature has since been built into the [IMPress plugin](https://github.com/idxbroker/wordpress-plugin).
Please use the [official repository](https://github.com/idxbroker/wordpress-plugin) now as this one has been deprecated.



To use the omnibar widget, install this plugin into your WordPress installation, enter an API key for your IDX Broker account under the settings tab, and drag the omnibar or omnibar with extra fields widget into a widget area in your theme. 
You can also use shortcodes via the IDX button when editing or adding a page or post.
