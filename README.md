# idx-omnibar
A WordPress Plugin creating an Omnibar Search Widget for use with IDX Broker.

DO NOT contact IDX Broker for support on this plugin as this is a third party plugin.

This is a WordPress plugin requiring the IDX Broker plugin to be installed.
From there, it pulls in Cities, Counties, and Zip Codes via the API allowing users to search by City, County, Zipcode, MLS#, and Address.

Install the IDX Broker plugin, then install this plugin. Once installed, you will be able to add the IDX Omnibar widget to any widget area. When dowloading the .zip from this repo, rememeber to remove the -master that gihub adds before you upload to WordPress.
